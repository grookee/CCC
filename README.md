# CCC
cloudflight coding contest

▪ In this level the drone can only fly up or down
▪ The time of a flight is measured in ticks
▪ For every tick you are given the velocity at that time
▪ If the drone is flying up, the velocity is positive
▪ If the drone is flying down, the velocity is negative
▪ Every tick, the drone’s height will be updated based on the current velocity
▪ At the beginning, the drone is at height 0
▪ The height will never be negative during the flight
▪ The drone took multiple flights
▪ For each flight calculate the drone's final height
